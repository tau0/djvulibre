.SH NAME
djvuextract \- Extract chunks from DjVu image files.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "djvuextract [-page=" "pagenum" "] " "djvufile" " [" "chkid" "=" "filename" "]..." 

.SH DESCRIPTION
Program
.B djvuextract
extracts raw chunk data from a DjVu file
.IR djvufile .
These chunks can then be re-assembled into DjVu files
using program
.BR djvumake .

Option 
.B -page
can be used to specify a particular page.
Otherwise the first page of the document is assumed.
Each remaining argument specifies that the raw data 
associated with all the chunks named
.I chkid 
will be concatenated into the file named
.IR filename .
Chunks named 
.B BG44
and 
.B FG44
are handled slightly differently:
the program generates legal
.SM IW44
files instead of simply saving the
raw data.

See the man page 
.BR djvumake (1)
for related information.

This program was written by L\('eon Bottou <leonb@users.sourceforge.net> and
was then improved by Andrei Erofeev <andrew_erofeev@yahoo.com>, Bill Riemers
<docbill@sourceforge.net> and many others.

This directory contains various files
that can be used for registering the djvu icons,
the djvu mime types, and the djview menu entries.

There are two ways to exploit them.


1 - Install desktop files with Portland tools.
----------------------------------------------

  When you pass option "--enable-desktopfiles" to 
  the "configure" script, the "make install" procedure 
  installs two scripts named
    "${datadir}/djvu/osi/desktop/register-djvu-mime", and
    "${datadir}/djvu/djview3/desktop/register-djview-menu".
  The directory "${datadir}" is usually "${prefix}/share".
  This is "/usr/local/share" unless you specify an alternate
  prefix when running "configure".

  This scripts rely on the so called XDG Portland tools
  to install or uninstall the icons, the mime types,
  and the menu entries for various desktop environment.
  They must be called with argument "install" or "uninstall".

  Calling "${datadir}/djvu/osi/desktop/register-djvu-mime install"
  installs icons for the djvu files and registers the djvu mime type.


2 - Install desktop files by hand.
----------------------------------

  The XDG Portland tools are not very desirable 
  when preparing binary packages because they do not
  implement the DESTDIR variable (as of version 1.0.1.)
  
  Although it is possible to call the scripts during
  the postinstallation or the preremove phases,
  it is usually preferable to install the desktop
  files by hand.

  In the following we assume that "${prefix}" 
  is "/usr" and "${datadir}" is then "/usr/share".
  We also assume that the desktop environment
  were installed with the same prefixes.

  The following files should be installed:

  * Mime type icons:
    - Install "hi22-djvu.png" 
      as "${datadir}/icons/hicolor/22x22/mimetypes/image-vnd.djvu.mime.png"
    - Install "hi32-djvu.png" 
      as "${datadir}/icons/hicolor/32x32/mimetypes/image-vnd.djvu.mime.png"
    - Install "hi48-djvu.png" 
      as "${datadir}/icons/hicolor/48x48/mimetypes/image-vnd.djvu.mime.png"

  * Mime type files:
    - Under KDE3, install "vnd.djvu.desktop"
      as "${datadir}/mimelnk/image/vnd.djvu.desktop".
    - In the past it was useful to install "djvulibre-mime.xml"
      as "${datadir}/mime/packages/djvulibre-mime.xml"
      and arrange to execute script "update-mime-database" 
      at installation time. This is no longer necessary
      because djvu information comes with the freedesktop.org
      mime type database.

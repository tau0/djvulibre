1- How to build on Windows
===========================

1.1- Using Microsoft Visual C++ 2010
------------------------------------

   See the directory win32.
   Populate the zlib, jpeg and tiff directories with
   the open source code suggested in the README files.
   Check win32/djvulibre/dirs.props to see
   how to name the directories.
   Then open win32/djvulibre/djvulibre.sln and compile.

   Next step would then be to follow the instructions
   in the djview package to create a djview project and
   add it to this solution. Finally you can use the script
   djvulibre-install.sh and djvulibre.nsi to prepare
   the djvulibre+djview installer.


1.2- Using Mingw
----------------

   You must first install the mingw compiler and the msys environment.
   See www.mingw.org for more information.
   From the msys shell, run the usual commands 
     $ configure
     $ make
   Then collect the djvulibre dll from directory libdjvu/.libs
   and the executables from directory tools/.libs 
   Please refer to the file INSTALL for information
   about the arguments of the script 'configure'.


1.3- Using Cygwin 
-----------------

   Simply run the usual commands 
     $ configure
     $ make
     $ make install
   Please refer to the file INSTALL for information
   about the arguments of the script 'configure'.
